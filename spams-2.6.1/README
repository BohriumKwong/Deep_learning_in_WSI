# SPAMS 2.6.1 and python

This directory contains files to install and use (at the end) the python interfaces
to the functions of the SPAMS library (originally interfaced with Matlab).

Manipulated objects are imported from numpy and scipy. Matrices should be stored by columns, and sparse matrices should be "column compressed".

This version is specifically designed to be used with the Anaconda python distribution (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) and benefits from the MKL Intel library (available with Anaconda).

The python SPAMS package consists of 4 files:
* `spams.py`
* `myscipy_rand.py`
* `spams_wrap.py`
* `_spams_wrap.so`

that should be in the path of the python interpreter (for instance in the current directory).

**NOTE:** myscipy_rand.py supplies a random generator for sparse matrix
      for some old scipy distributions

**WARNING:** the API of spams.OMP and spams.OMPMask has changed since version V2.2

Available functions in python are defined in `spams.py` and documented (the doc is extracted from matlab files).

This file describes how to directly install the interface from sources. More details are given
in the file [INSTALL-package](./INSTALL-package).

Porting to python3.x is based on https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-spams-svn/

## INTERFACE INSTALLATION (python3.x) for LINUX and MacOS

### Installation

Packages required: python-numpy, python-scipy, anaconda or miniconda. <br>

Create a virtual environment and install required packages with conda:
```bash
conda create -n spams
source activate spams
conda install -c intel mkl # generally not necessary because already included in anaconda
conda install numpy scipy six
```

Install from sources:
```bash
tar zxf spams-python.anaconda-v2.6.1-2017-12-08.tar.gz
cd spams-2.6.1
python setup.py build

inst=<your-python-install-dir>
python setup.py install --prefix=$inst
```

Two documentations are installed in `$inst/doc`:
* doc_spams.pdf and html/index.html : the detailed user documentation
* sphinx/index.html : the documentation of python function extracted by sphinx

### Testing the interface :

```bash
PYV=`python -c "import sys;t='{v[0]}.{v[1]}'.format(v=list(sys.version_info[:2]));sys.stdout.write(t)";` # get python current version
export PYTHONPATH=$inst/lib/python${PYV}/site-packages
cd $inst/test
python test_spams.py -h # to get help
python test_spams.py  # will run all the tests
python test_spams.py linalg # test of linalg functions
python test_spams.py name1 name2 ... # run named tests
```
